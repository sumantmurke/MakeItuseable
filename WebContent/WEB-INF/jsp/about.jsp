					<h3>About US</h3>
					<p style="font-size: 16px;">
						Not all small and mid-scale companies want to maintain professional testing employees for full-time or if some of the testers around the globe like freelance testers want to engage themselves in testing jobs like these.
						<br/><br/>
						Capable usability testers (working as a tester or freelance testers) should be able to search for software projects for testing through which they can hone their skills and showcase their talent to customers / organizations.
						<br/><br/>
						Customers who want their projects to be tested to gain various perspectives related to usability testing need to get in touch with skilled testers and obtain various inputs to improve upon the software design.
						<br/><br/>
						The website aims to bridge the above gap between the two user groups by providing an interaction channel.
						<br/><br/>
						It provides a means for customers to post various projects and allow usability testers to bid on those projects. The customer can then accept a particular bid based on various parameters. After the tester completes the testing of the project, the customer can review the tester based on his work.
						<br/><br/>
						Usability testers can look for projects that suit their profile and domain, and work on the software design of the project by providing suitable reports to the customer after completing the testing. A tester can earn reviews for his work and get future contracts from customers based on his previous work.
